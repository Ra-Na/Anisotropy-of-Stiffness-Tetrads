[1] "**_Distance of a stiffness tetrad to the symmetry classes of linear elasticity_**" [DOI: 10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2018.08.021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijsolstr.2018.08.021)

by M. Weber, R. Gl√ºge and A. Bertram.

The Mathematica-Script calculates the distances of a given stiffness C tetrad to its 
projections C_i=P_i * C onto 7 of the 8 symmetry classes of elasticity (every C is trclinic). The distance is defined as d_i=1-|C_i|/|C|, being 0 if C falls into the symmetry class i and not exceeding 1. As the axes of anisotropy are unknown, d is minimized over three rotation angles.
